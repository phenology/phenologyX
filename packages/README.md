## /packages

Use this directory for reusable (Python) code snippets. Python modules stored in
these folders can be imported when working in the `../notebooks` and
`../scripts` directory as if they were installed directly from PyPi.

The `/springtime` directory is intended for project-specific code snippets. Once
snippets start to turn into self-contained models, consider extracting them into
their own top-level packages (such as `/py_ppo`).
