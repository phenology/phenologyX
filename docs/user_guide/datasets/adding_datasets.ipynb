    "up on their documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Utils\n",
    "\n",
    "Several dataset need to do very similar operations, such as resample. To avoid\n",

    "couple of generalized functions are available in `springtime.utils`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adding your model to springtime\n",
    "\n",
    "It probably makes sense to start developing your dataset class in a notebook or\n",
    "simply python script. However, it would be much nicer if you can make your\n",
    "dataset part of the springtime package. To this end, first, have a look at the\n",
    "[contributing guide](../../develop).\n",
    "\n",
    "After cloning the source code and making an editable installation, you can add\n",
    "you dataset class to a new file in the datasets folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Registering your dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "To make sure your dataset is recognized by springtime, you have to add it to the\n",

    "To ensure continuity, we have a couple of [tests for each\n",
    "dataset](https://github.com/phenology/springtime/tree/main/tests/datasets). When\n",
    "you add a new dataset, it is probably a good idea to copy the tests of an\n",
