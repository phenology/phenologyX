Springtime executes machine learning algorithms that are supported by the
package [PyCaret](https://pycaret.readthedocs.io/). PyCaret is a Python wrapper
around several machine learning libraries and frameworks such as
[scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/), and
[XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). In addition, springtime
supports [mixed effects random forest
(MERF)](https://manifoldai.github.io/merf/) and Glassbox Models from
[InterpretML](https://interpret.ml/docs/intro.html).
