We provide several "recipes" for downloading [data from various
sources](https://springtime.readthedocs.io/en/latest/datasets/) and executing a
range of [machine learning
methods](https://springtime.readthedocs.io/en/latest/models/) with it.

Note that a "recipe" is a file in [yaml format](https://yaml.org/).

??? example "Model comparison usecase"
    ```yaml
    {% include "../src/springtime/recipes/model_comparison_usecase.yaml" %}
    ```
