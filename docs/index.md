# Springtime

Spatiotemporal phenology research with interpretable models.

Phenology is a scientific discipline in which we study the lifecycle of plants
and animals. In the Springtime project, we aim to develop (Machine Learning)
models for the occurrence of phenological events, such as the blooming of plants.
Since there is a variety of data sources, a substantial part of this project
focuses on data retrieval and pre-processing as well.

We try to use existing tools as much as possible. At the same time, working with
many different datasets and a variety of tools to download them, project folders
and code organization can quickly get messy. That's why we focus heavily on
streamlining our workflows, such that you can always execute them with a single
command. We use standardized locations for storing raw and intermediate data,
and a standardized "recipe" format to define the steps in our workflows.

## Detailed info

## Example task:

Predict the day of first bloom of the common lilac given indirect observations
(e.g. satellite data) and/or other indicators (e.g. sunshine and temperature).
