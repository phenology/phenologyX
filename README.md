# Springtime
Spatiotemporal phenology research with interpretable models.

We recommend setting up a rich working environment, e.g. using [mambaforge](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html#installation):

```
mamba create -n springtime python=3 jupyterlab numpy pandas xarray matplotlib cartopy requests pytest isort black scipy joblib scikit-learn seaborn
```

We anticipate that parts of this repository might turn into self-contained packages. At that stage we will clarify the exact reqruiements in those packages.
